3-8. Seeing the World: Think of at least five places in the world you’d like
to visit.
• Store the locations in a list. Make sure the list is not in alphabetical order.
• Print your list in its original order. Don’t worry about printing the list neatly;
just print it as a raw Python list.
• Use sorted() to print your list in alphabetical order without modifying the
actual list.
• Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it.
• Use sorted() to print your list in reverse-alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list.
• Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it again.
• Use reverse() to change the order of your list. Print the list to show that its
order has changed.
• Use reverse() to change the order of your list again. Print the list to show
it’s back to its original order.
• Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in alphabetical order. Print the
list to show that its order has been changed.
• Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in reverse-alphabetical order.
Print the list to show that its order has changed.

3-9. Dinner Guests: Working with one of the programs from Exercises 3-4
through 3-7 (pages 41–42), use len() to print a message indicating the number
of people you’re inviting to dinner.

3-10. Every Function: Think of things you could store in a list. For example, you
could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything
else you’d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items and
then uses each function introduced in this chapter at least once
append(): Adds an item to the end of the list.
insert(): Adds an item at the specified index.
pop(): Removes and returns the last item or the item at the specified index.
remove(): Removes the first occurrence of the specified item.
sort(): Sorts the list in ascending order.
reverse(): Reverses the order of the list.
len(): Returns the number of items in the list.
del: Deletes the item at the specified index.
Indexing ([0]): Accesses a specific item in the list.
Slicing ([:3]): Extracts a portion of the list.
