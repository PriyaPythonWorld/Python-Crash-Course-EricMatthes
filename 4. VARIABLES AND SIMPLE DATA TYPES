2-11. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and 
add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write 
because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the 
current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing 
what the program does

# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Current Date]
# This program calculates the sum of two numbers.

a = 5
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Output the sum of a and b

# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: [Current Date]
# This program prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

print("Hello, World!")  # Display a greeting message
